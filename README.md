# 👋 Hi, I'm Jim Gaudette

I am a senior software engineer and systems builder with over 30 years of experience delivering enterprise platforms, AI-driven automation, and embedded tooling.

I focus on building real, practical software that removes friction from everyday digital work, from regulated banking systems to accessibility-focused screen automation.

This work targets automation and accessibility problems that traditional browser plugins, RPA tools, and cloud agents consistently fail to solve, especially in locked-down or regulated environments.

I build across three layers:

- **AI systems**: LLM orchestration, OCR, vision pipelines, agent-guided automation  
- **Enterprise engineering**: .NET services, cloud platforms, secure workflow systems  
- **Embedded devices**: ESP32, RP2040, USB HID bridges, BLE, hardware-integrated automation

## 🚀 What I Build

### **AI + Screen Automation**
Systems that let AI observe a screen, infer structure and intent, then take action through a hardware keyboard bridge.  
No APIs. No browser plugins. Just pixels in, keystrokes out.

### **Embedded + Automation Tools**
Custom devices that bridge mobile apps, PCs, and automation flows, including ESP32/RP2040-based HID, BLE links, sensor integration, and performance-critical controllers.

### **Enterprise Software**
Large-scale .NET and Angular applications for regulated environments, including banking, finance, and secure portals.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### **Sightline (Provisional Patent Filed)**
A visual-state engine that analyzes any screen, identifies fields, labels, and error states, and directs AI orchestration for step-by-step workflow completion.

### **CrossPort (Provisional Patent Filed)**
A microcontroller-powered USB keyboard that restores clipboard freedom in locked-down environments.  
HID-only operation, no drivers, no traces.  
Designed for accessibility and constrained automation.

### **KeyCatcher**
An ESP32-based tool that captures, forwards, or transforms input across devices (Android ↔ PC) using BLE and USB HID.  
Useful for automation, accessibility, and cross-device control.

### **CoachPort**
A MAUI and Playwright-based system that assists with job applications by parsing forms, identifying required fields, and automating navigation and completion.
